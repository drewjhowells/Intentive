Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) teaches that our thoughts affect our emotions and behaviors. By identifying and challenging unhelpful thoughts, we can change our emotional state and actions.

One core CBT strategy is cognitive restructuring: notice automatic negative thoughts, assess their accuracy, and replace them with more balanced alternatives.

Another is behavioral activation: take small, positive actions even when unmotivated to disrupt negative thought cycles.

CBT encourages keeping thought journals and using mental check-ins to become aware of negative thinking patterns.
