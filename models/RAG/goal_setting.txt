Goal-setting theory suggests that people are more likely to succeed when they set specific, challenging, and achievable goals. Vague goals like "do better" are less motivating than specific ones like "write 300 words daily."

Breaking larger goals into smaller subgoals helps maintain motivation by providing regular reinforcement and reducing overwhelm.

Effective goals are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.

Commitment and feedback also enhance goal success. People are more likely to stick with goals they believe in and receive regular feedback on.
