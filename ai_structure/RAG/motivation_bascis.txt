Motivation is driven by both external rewards and internal desires. The most sustainable form of motivation comes from internal factors like purpose, autonomy, and mastery.

According to Self-Determination Theory, people are more motivated when they feel in control of their actions, competent in their abilities, and connected to others.

Rewards can help start a behavior, but over time, intrinsic motivation is more powerful and lasting.

Start small. Even the smallest action can increase motivation and reduce inertia.
